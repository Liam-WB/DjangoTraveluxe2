## Agile Methodology

Agile methodolgy was used frequently, to help create a clean, organised and well-ordered experience for myself as a devloper when creating the building blocks for this website. Agile methodology was used in the creation of the user-stories as well as the project boards on GitHub. A template was also made to define epics and effectively write up my user stories:

* Firstly, the Epics were written containing potential user stories, based on order priority and in order of when they would be required.
* User stories were made by looking at these epics, and again based on the project's timeline and progress.
* The project Board was used to track progression of the task through the Todo, In progress and Done columns.
* The project Board ias set to public at the end.
